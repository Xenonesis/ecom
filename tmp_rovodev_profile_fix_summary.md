# Profile Page Fix Summary

## Problem
The profile page was showing "Failed to load profile" error with 401 Unauthorized responses. The logs showed:
```
Auth error: Error [AuthSessionMissingError]: Auth session missing!
GET /api/profile 401
```

## Root Causes
1. **Middleware not protecting /profile route**: The middleware was only protecting `/seller`, `/admin`, `/checkout`, and `/orders`, but not `/profile`
2. **Race condition in client-side auth**: The profile page was checking the client-side auth store (`user` from zustand) which starts as `null` and gets populated asynchronously
3. **Outdated middleware implementation**: Using deprecated `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` package

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated middleware.ts
- Replaced deprecated `createMiddlewareClient` from `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` with `createServerClient` from `@supabase/ssr`
- Added `/profile` to the list of protected routes
- Updated the config matcher to include `/profile`

**Key changes:**
- Now properly handles cookie management with the new SSR package
- Middleware will redirect unauthenticated users to `/login` before they can access `/profile`
- This prevents the API route from being called without a valid session

### 2. Updated app/profile/page.tsx
- Removed the client-side `if (!user)` check that was causing race conditions
- The middleware now handles authentication, so we don't need to check client-side auth state
- Added a 401 status check as a fallback to redirect to login if somehow the API returns unauthorized

**Key changes:**
- Removed dependency on `user` from the useEffect dependencies
- API call happens immediately without checking client state first
- Cleaner separation of concerns: middleware handles auth, component handles data fetching

## How It Works Now

1. User navigates to `/profile`
2. **Middleware intercepts** the request and checks for a valid session
3. If no session exists, user is **redirected to `/login`** before the page even loads
4. If session exists, the page loads and calls `/api/profile`
5. The API route receives a valid session from cookies and returns the profile data
6. No more 401 errors or "Failed to load profile" messages for authenticated users

## Testing
To verify the fix works:
1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/profile **without being logged in**
   - Should redirect to `/login` (middleware protection)
3. Log in with valid credentials
4. Navigate to `/profile` again
   - Should load profile successfully without errors
   - No more "Auth session missing" errors in console
